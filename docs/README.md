## Documentation Philosophy

- **Single source of truth:** Each topic is owned by exactly one document. Cross-reference by linking rather than duplicating.
- **Security-first:** All guides assume the vault protects high-value secrets. Implementation notes emphasize confidentiality and integrity.
- **Automation aware:** Every procedure includes command-line snippets or scripts that can be automated later.
- **Platform neutral:** Unless stated otherwise, instructions apply to Linux, macOS, and Windows.
